# A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the Blood Bank Management System 1.0 within the receiverLogin.php component. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. By manipulating the remail and rpassword fields, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the system.
