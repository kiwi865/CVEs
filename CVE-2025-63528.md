# A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Blood Bank Management System 1.0 within the blooddinfo.php component. The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before rendering it in response. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into the error parameter, which is then executed in the victim's browser when the page is viewed.
