# A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Blood Bank Management System 1.0 within the updateprofile.php and hprofile.php components. The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before rendering it in response. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into the hname, hemail, hpassword, hphone, hcity parameters, which are then executed in the victim's browser when the page is viewed.

Login to the application and navigate to rprofile.php. Trigger an update to the profile.
