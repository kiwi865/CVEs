# FeehiCMS version 2.1.1 fails to enforce server-side immutability for parameters that are presented to clients as "read-only." An authenticated attacker can intercept and modify the parameter in transit and the backend accepts the changes. This can lead to unintended username changes.

Register two users, user1 and user2.
