# A session fixation vulnerability exists in Blood Bank Management System 1.0 in login.php that allows an attacker to set or predict a user's session identifier prior to authentication. When the victim logs in, the application continues to use the attacker-supplied session ID rather than generating a new one, enabling the attacker to hijack the authenticated session and gain unauthorized access to the victim's account.

Before login, notice the PHPSESSID.

After login, notice that the PHPSESSID remains unchanged.
