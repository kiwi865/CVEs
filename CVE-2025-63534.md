# A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Blood Bank Management System 1.0 within the login.php component. The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before rendering it in response. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into the msg and error parameters, which are then executed in the victim's browser when the page is viewed.
